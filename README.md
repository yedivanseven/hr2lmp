*The Haskell Road to Logic, Math and Programming*

by Kees Doets and Jan van Eijck (2004)

## Prelude
This repository is very much work in progress. As we go through the book, all
*coding* exercises will eventually be available. Note that solutions to the
pen-and-paper, mathematical exercises are generally *not* provided (unless their answer is a simple yes/no or true/false).

## Disclaimer
There is no guarantee whatsoever that the solutions are actually correct.

## Chapter 1
All (working) examples, solutions to all exercises, and some playing around.

## Chapter 2
All examples and solutions to all coding exercises.
